# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction

For this project, we analyzed data regarding the film industry. We reviewed data for over 5000 movies (spanning back to the early 1900s) in order to discover trends signifying which movies were more succesful (both critically and financially). In order to get the data collection of movies to review, we used API Calls, Webscraping and Request Libraries. For further analysis, we created data visualizations by using MatPlotLib, Seaborn and Pandas.   

## Objectives

Using the data that we collected, we wanted to answer the following questions:

* Is the movie industry a growing industry?
* Do movies need to have a big production budget in order to be financially succesful?
* Which movie genres are the most profitable?
* Which movie genres are the most enjoyed by filmgoers? 
* Are movies with a specific MPAA rating more profitable than the others? 
* Is there a relationship between the duration of a movie and its net profit? If so, are short movies or long movies more profitable?
* Does the release date matter?

Jupyter Notebooks
* project_1.ipynb - using webscraping of Box Office Mojo website, API calls with TMDB to get data from online resources, clean up the data, sort out the data, analyze data and then explores the relationships between profit margin and various Movie Genres, Production Budget and different movie genres, popularity vs movie genres, runtime vs profit margin. Vote average and vote counts are also visualized and discussed. Notebook also analyzed if release date affect movie profit margin and popularity.

## Conclusion

Based on the data that we accumulated, we were able to come to a few conclusions regarding movies that are the most profitable and popular:
* The genre of movies that are most popular are Action, Fantasy, Sci Fi and Adventure movies. The genre of movies that have the highest profit margin are Crime, Horror, Thriller and Action movies. 
* PG-13 rated movies are the most profitable while G rated movies and R rated movies are the least profitable.
* Although movies with a very high production budget usually bring in the most net profit, there is not much of a difference in net profit between movies with a production budget of $40,000,000 or less.
* Movies between 90 minutes and 180 minutes are the most profitable and popular
