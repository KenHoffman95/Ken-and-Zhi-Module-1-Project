# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction

For this project, we analyzed data regarding the film industry. We reviewed data for over 5000 movies (spanning back to the early 1900s) in order to discover trends signifying which movies were more succesful (both critically and financially). In order to get the data collection of movies to review, we used API Calls, Webscraping and Request Libraries. For further analysis, we created data visualizations by using MatPlotLib and Pandas.   

## Objectives

Using the data that we collected, we wanted to answer the following questions:

* Is the movie industry a growing industry?
* Do movies need to have a big production budget in order to be financially succesful?
* Which movie genres are the most profitable?
* Which movie genres are the most enjoyed by filmgoers? 
* Are movies with a specific MPAA rating more profitable than the others? 
* Is there a relationship between the duration of a movie and its net profit? If so, are short movies or long movies more profitable?
